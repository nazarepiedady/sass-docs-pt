title: "@for"
introduction: >
  The `@for` rule, written `@for <variable> from <expression> to <expression>
  { ... }` or `@for <variable> from <expression> through <expression> { ... }`,
  counts up or down from one number (the result of the first
  [expression](../../syntax/structure#expressions)) to another (the result of
  the second) and evaluates a block for each number in between. Each number
  along the way is assigned to the given variable name. If `to` is used, the
  final number is excluded; if `through` is used, it's included.

<% example do %>
  $base-color: #036;

  @for $i from 1 through 3 {
    ul:nth-child(3n + #{$i}) {
      background-color: lighten($base-color, $i * 5%);
    }
  }
  ===
  $base-color: #036

  @for $i from 1 through 3
    ul:nth-child(3n + #{$i})
      background-color: lighten($base-color, $i * 5%)
