  In older versions of LibSass and Ruby Sass, the [`call()` function][] took a
  string representing a function's name. This was changed to take a function
  value instead in preparation for a new module system where functions are no
  longer global and so a given name may not always refer to the same function.

  [`call()` function]: /documentation/modules/meta#call

  Passing a string to `call()` still works in all implementations, but it's
  deprecated and will be disallowed in future versions.
