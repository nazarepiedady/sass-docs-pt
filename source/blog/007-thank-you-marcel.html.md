You may not know [Marcel Greter](https://github.com/mgreter), but you almost
certainly know his work. For more than two years, he has been the #1 contributor
on LibSass and is the #2 contributor for the history of the project. His
monumental efforts, together with [Michael Mifsud](https://github.com/xzyfer),
are what has kept LibSass thriving recently and why it has reached feature
parity with Ruby Sass and is now used by more users than Ruby Sass every day.

Presently, as we are pivoting to a new development model and release cadence,
Marcel has decided it is the best time for him to exit the LibSass core team. We
are truly sad to see him go, but we wish him well in all his new endeavors.
Please join us in thanking him for all his hard work. You can follow and tweet
him [@mgreter](https://twitter.com/mgreter).

Unfortunately, this leaves the LibSass project with some big shoes to fill.
LibSass is a popular project that has more than 1.5 Million downloads a month
and as of right now, it is in desparate need of new contributors.

We have a bunch of new features planned for Sass 3.5 that need to be implemented
in LibSass and we want to do a coordinated release of both Ruby Sass and LibSass
as soon as we can. If you can write production quality C++ and want to build
parsers and compilers, we would love to help you become a contributor. If you
don't have free time, but still want to contribute, consider asking your
workplace to support the project by donating a percentage of your time.
