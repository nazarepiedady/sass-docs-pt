title: About Sass
---

Sass was originally developed as a feature of the Haml markup language. Since
then, Sass has outgrown its original home as part of Haml and is now a thriving
project, much more popular than its original host project.

### Sass Language

Sass was originally conceived of by [Hampton Catlin][] in 2006, but he only
remained an active Core Team member through 2009 and is no longer actively
developing Sass. [Natalie Weizenbaum][] is the primary developer and designer of
Sass and has been involved in the project since the second commit. [Chris
Eppstein][] joined the Sass Core Team in 2008 and also created Compass, the
first major Sass framework. Since joining, he and Natalie have designed Sass
together have created most of the modern features of the language.

## Sass Website, Brand, and Design

The Sass website design was brought to you largely by [Jina Anne][], with major
contributions from Bermon Painter (who designed the logo], Michael Parenteau,
and the Sass Language Core Team.
